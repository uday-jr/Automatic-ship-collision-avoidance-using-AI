# Automatic-ship-collision-avoidance-using-AI
To avoid Ship collisions especialy in congested waters, AI algorithms were used to estimate trajectory of ship, detect collisions and can avoid them by taking better decisions


## Input 
Size of grid environment, number of ships(including own ship), position of own ship

## Output
Next move of the ship based on the estimated trajectory is of minimal in cost and without any chances of collision
